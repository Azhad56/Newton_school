Strings in java
=================

Strings in Java are Objects 
backed by internally char array


Strings are immutable in Java ( 2 questions why strings are immutable? , How to make a class immutable)

Strings are used in hashmap as a code
strings are used for caching
strings are used router, 
strings are for device driver classes in JAVA

How to define strings in java

String s1 = "starwars"; - ----1
String s1 = new String("starwars");--- 2

Whenever strings are created without "new" key, there are created as string literals in string
constant pool. This helps JVM to initialize the string fast.


Java memory

string constant pool
Heap = objects are created on heap memory

String s2 = "starwars"; // string constant pool;

  s1=  starwars
  s2

BUT NOW

 String s1 = new String("starwars");
 String s2=  new String("starwars");


Difference between "==" and equals method


== (this compares the address of two variables, two objects and two data types)

equals() -- it does content comparison...


The main difference between the .equals() method and == operator 
is that one is a method and the other is the operator.


We can use == operators for reference comparison (address comparison) and
 .equals() method for content comparison. In simple words, == checks 
if both objects point to the same memory location whereas .equals() 
evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects.


public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {

T F T T
        String s1 = "HELLO";
        String s2 = "DELHI";
        String s3 =  new String("HELLO");
        System.out.println(s1 == s2); = true
        System.out.println(s1 == s3); = false
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); true
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s3)); true
    }
}


Anagrams

 LISTEN SILENT

Collections.sort("LISTEN");
Collections.sort("SILENT");
eilnst

  if( s1.equals(s2))
  {

    SYSO("both strings are anagrams of each other:)

  }

  else
    "No anagrams found"
